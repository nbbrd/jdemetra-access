This [JDemetra+](https://github.com/jdemetra/jdemetra-app) extension is a pure java library for reading time series from [MS Access databases](http://www.microsoft.com/office/access/default.asp).  
It currently supports versions 2000-2016 read/write and 97 read-only.

Being a pure Java library, you don't need MS Access installed in order to read Access files.
